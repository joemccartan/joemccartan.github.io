            <p>Summer is the warmest season of the year, falling between spring and autumn. Temperatures over the period differ based upon the location on the Earth; regions near the equator are typically warmer than those lying near the poles. This is because, due to the curve of the Earth, these places receive the most sunlight, according to Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. The areas around the Earth's poles also have ice, which reflect a lot of the sun's rays. </p>
