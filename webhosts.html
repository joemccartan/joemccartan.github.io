    <h1><a href="https://www.godaddy.com">GoDaddy</a></h1>

    <p>GoDaddy is a very good option when it comes to webhosts for several different reasons. They offer different price points for different kinds of features that include paying more for a .org suffix, or a little less for .me which is all about a person. They have discounts for websites where you can create a .com domain for just $12.99 the first year. They have 24/7 customer service, and gaurantee a 99.9% uptime. You can also hire a design pro to build a premium website if that's the direction you want to head with a free consultation. They also allow you to create a professional email to attract more customers.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://www.siteground.com">SiteGround</a></h1>

    <p>Siteground seems to be another solid option as they have about 2,000,000 domains owned by users. They offer three different packages starting at $6.99 a month where you can get one free website, a proffesional email, backups, and unlimited databases. The middle option is $9.99 a month and has all the same features just offers unlimited websites and 20 GB of web space. The most expensive option is $14.99 a month and has the same features, but offers 40 GB of web space. They offer 24/7 support for users and offer professionals to help with building websites. This is a good looking site, but doesn't seem to offer the amount of options and features that godaddy has in comparison.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://www.fatcow.com">FatCow</a></h1>

    <p>FatCow is the last site I looked at and they also claim to have 24/7 customer support. On first glance, the website looks less appealing which doesn't have to do with their service but can turn away customers. They also let you customize an email address to make it look professional. They have site builders to make customizing a website easy. They also offer a free domain name or free domain transfer. Fatcow has a business mission statement of making a website easy to create and use. They only offer one option at $4.08 a month which is cheap but concerningly cheap. </p>

    <h1>My Decision:</h1>
    <p>If I have to choose one web host out of the three I looked at, I would have to go with SiteBuilder. I liked the simplicity of the website and the three options that it offers. It has good pricing, support, and reviews. GoDaddy would also be a great option, but SiteBuilder just slightly takes the edge for me.</p>
