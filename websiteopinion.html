    <h1>Three Website Opinion:</h1>

    <h2><a link href="https://www.petsmart.com/">PetSmart</a> (Good Website):</h2>

    <p>
        I really like the Petsmart website for the simple fact that it is well branded and a very simple layout. It is very easy to navigate and find exactly what you are looking for. It is a clean looking code incorporating a lot ot html elements that we are currently using in the class. The different in window size is well adjusted for on this website, making it easy to navigate regardless of the size. They have the branding colors of red, white, and blue through the whole website making it simple yet effective to show what company you are looking at. The red circle on the tab of the website is a cool touch, along with great pictures and logos all over to make it recognizable.

    <h2><a link href="https://shop.lululemon.com/">LuluLemon</a> (Good Website):</h2>

    <p>
        Lululemon has a really cool website that I think works very well for a clothing company. It is very appealing to the eye with the simplicity and good quality pictures that advertise the merchandise. It's extremely easy to navigate with just about 5 tabs for different pages to go to making it easy to find what You're looking for. The website fits really well in all sizes of windows which is extremely nice. There aren't many colors at all because the page gets filled up with pictures of clothing with pricing and other colors that it comes in. The website also uses a lot of the html elements that I have seen and the code seems to make sense relatively. It's a lot of images to make the website funcitonal so the code kind of looks repetitive in certain parts. It seems to be pretty modern and very effective. I like the spacing between images, how there is good spacing when the page is full size, and less spacing when the window is smaller.

    <h2><a link href="https://helena.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a> (Bad Website):</h2>

    <p>
        I find Craigslist to be a very overwhelming site and can be fairly difficult to navigate. I don't like how many options there are to select from right at the home page. The font is very small and hard to read, and ultimately very difficult to reach the exact thing you are looking for. After inspecting the page, I saw that the do use html elements that I am fimiliar with, but there are a few things that I am unsure of. When it comes to color, it's kind of irrelevant. It's a simple white background with blue texts that are all links so it's not exciting at all, and very basic. When the window is smaller you have to slide side to side in order to see all of the page. It's a very overall averwhleming website and isn't pleasent to look at either.
