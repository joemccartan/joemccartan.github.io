<h1>States Assignment</h1>

<h2>
    <a href="https://www.vermont.gov/"> 1. Vermont</a>
</h2>
<p>My favorite state website out of the five is easily Vermont. I love the overall look of the website, along with the ease of navigation it offers. It has really great colors and fits all size windows very well.I love the simplicity but how well the pictures clash, and it's perfectly easy to follow. It just looks extremely appealing over the other four possible options.</p>


<h2>
    <a href="https://www.tn.gov/"> 2. Tennessee</a>
</h2>
<p>Tennessee did a really good job with the navigation aspect of their website. It does really well with different sizes of windows and on the phone. I like the colors it makes it really easy to follow and clashes very well. This is high on the list at second, but doesn't quite beat Vermont for me. I like all of the different articles that can be clicked on straight from the website. </p>

<h2>
    <a href="https://www.oklahoma.gov/"> 3. Oklahoma</a>
</h2>
<p>I really enjoyed the simplicity and color of the Oklahoma website. I would definitely put in more navigation tools to make it slightly easier but I just love the way that it looks. It's clear where to search and has a limited number of options so it's not overwhleming at all. I really like the layout and it works well in many different window sizes. </p>

<h2>
    <a href="https://www.iowa.gov/"> 4. Iowa</a>
</h2>
<p>Not a big fan of the Iowa website because of the overwhelming amount of blue it has all around. It doesn't utilize space very well, but it is not too bad to navigate through. It works with all sizes of windows, but doesn't look good at all when it gets small. I definitely like the look of the previous three just all around because Iowa doesn't appear as intriguing. They need to change the background of the site in my amatuer opinion.</p>

<h2>
    <a href="https://alaska.gov/"> 5. Alaska</a>
</h2>
<p>The first thing that I notice about the Alaska website is the corny large border surrounding the content. It just looks like they forgot to make the content bigger. It's all blue on the border, and more blue in the content, with gold here and there, and it just looks very corny to me. There are so many small links that are hard to read and need to be put in subcategories or something. It's very difficult to find anything I'm looking for. It also doesn't fit well at all in small windows which is a big issue for mobile users or small window browsers.</p>
