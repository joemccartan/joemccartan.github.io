            <h1 style="font-size:40px" align="center">How it began:</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 30px">This journey began like many other hobbies began at the time, boredom from social distancing. At first it was a small hobby because it seemed like a fun thing to occupy the uneventful days during the pandemic. Then it quickly switched to a high interest after researching all of the harmful products that go into the shampoo, soaps, deoderants, and toothpaste that we buy at our local super markets. Katie McCartan, creater of Katie's Kitchen kept researching new recipes to improve and master each product that she has been perfecting. Each product is all natural and is the what seperates Katie's Kitchen from all other personal hygiene brands. All of the products are so natural, that in fact you can eat every single product without any worry of harmful ingredients entering your body. These creations were originally just for family use, but as Katie shared her discoveries, her friends and family became intrigued and wanted to try some products for themselves. After hearing tons of great feedback from friends and family, she decided to offer it online and to the community. </p>
